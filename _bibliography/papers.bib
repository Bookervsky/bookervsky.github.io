abstract = {Freeway infrastructures play a pivotal role in driving socio-economic development. However, without a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between freeway network evolution and socio-economic dynamics, it would be difficult to further shape the economic landscape through adjustments in the freeway network layout. To address this challenge, the present study proposes an analytical framework that integrates network, spatial, and temporal elements to quantify the economic stimulatory effects of freeway network evolution. Multiscale geographically and temporally weighted regression (MGTWR) is employed to scrutinize these intricate relationships. This analytical framework is applied to an empirical case study based on the freeway geographic data, point of interest (POI) data, and socio-economic statistics spanning from 2018 to 2021 in Fujian, China. The spatio-temporal impacts of freeway evolution on socio-economic indicators, county-level POI clustering, and roadside POI clustering are investigated. Results demonstrate that considering network elements helps enhance the effectiveness of the analytical framework, and each network element exhibits distinct yet stable effects on socio-economic dynamics. Spatial heterogeneity is identified in the impact of freeway density on socio-economic growths, industrial relocations, and changes in roadside land use patterns. This study provides crucial insights for transportation infrastructure planning and assessment.}

abstract = {Urban public transportation is an important travel mode for alleviating traffic congestion and reducing environmental pollution. Exploring the interactive relationship between built environment and the distribution of public transport ridership is crucial for guiding the healthy development of public transportation system. This study explores the spatial distribution characteristics of public transportation trips guided by Point of Interest (POI). Based on empirical cases constructed using ridership data from Beijing's rail transit and ground-level buses, as well as POI data, this study applies the Thiessen polygon spatial partitioning method to divide the research area within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing into massive basic analysis units. Then, a geographically weighted regression model is employed to quantify the spatial correlation between different types of POIs and public transportation Origin-Destination (OD) points under various scenarios. The results show that there exists spatial heterogeneity between the “morning departure” and “evening return” of public transportation trips, with stronger spatial heterogeneity observed in subway OD than in bus OD. Different types of POIs exhibit differential attractiveness to public transportation trips. This study provides decision-making supports for urban spatial resource allocation and public transportation network planning.}
